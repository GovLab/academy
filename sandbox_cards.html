              <p>Liz is an activist and designer interested in collaborative urban environments. My early days in New York involved catalyzing public interactions on sidewalks and subway stations with a giant "Talk To Me" sign as well as working 25 floors above Wall Street (SOM) designing international new cities and campuses. I'm originally from North Carolina where I managed an urban agriculture youth enterprise called the Durham Inner-city Gardeners (DIG). Currently, when I'm not hoisting cameras up on balloons (with Public Laboratory) or hugging trees with tape measures (with TreeKIT), I teach geospatial tools for urban design at Columbia, Parsons, and Pratt.

              <h4>Coaching Programs Coordinator</h4>
              <p>Dinorah is a Human Rights lawyer and activist from Monterrey, Mexico. She moved to New York City since 2012 to study the MPA in Public and Nonprofit Management and Policy at NYU Robert F. Wagner School of Public Service because she was interested in the advocacy of economic, social and cultural rights. Now she believes the best advocacy agenda for every human right must involve and leverage the new communication and information technologies. As a fellow at the GovLab she will be researching and testing how experts systems can be used as a tool to better share knowledge and expertise. Ultimately, she hopes to explore and re-imagine our present, forming new communities and organizational structures guided by the principles of empathy and collaboration.Before she moved here, she was the founder and director of the Human Rights Center of the Facultad Libre de Derecho de Monterrey and volunteered for pro bono legal services. In her free time she is developing an online platform that will nurture a collaborative network of legal practitioners, activists and stakeholders.The platform will be intended to crowdsource legal arguments, infographics and visual media, a social media campaign and plaintiffs. The ultimate goal of the project is to create ready-to-print, ready-to-be-filed legal motions for constitutional control (Amparo) by anyone interested in advocating for any human rights cause.</p>

              <h4>Coordinator of the Citizen Cyberscience Centre</h4>
              <p>Francois Grey is a physicist by training, with a background in nanotechnology and a passion for citizen science. Since September 2014, he is Invited Professor at the University of Geneva and Manager of the Citizen Cyberscience Centre, a partnership between CERN, the United Nations Institute of Training and Research and the University of Geneva. 
<br/>
The CCC develops technologies that lower the barrier to entry for online participatory science and promotes the use of these technologies in developing regions through face-to-face meetups between scientists, developers and citizens. The CCC has helped to launch citizen science projects such as CERN’s Test4Theory, which is part of the LHC@home volunteer computing initiative, and open source platforms for citizen science like Crowdcrafting.org, for volunteer thinking. Events launched by the CCC include the Africa@Home, Asia@home and Brasil@home workshops series, the CERN Webfest and the biannual Citizen Cyberscience Summit. 
<br/>
From 2013-2014 Francois was Head of Citizen Science at NYU’s Center for Urban Science and Progress, where he launched the Science and the City hackathons in collaboration with ITP, NYU’s Interactive Telecommunications Program and Science Hack Day NYC in collaboration with the World Science Festival. 
<br/>
Francois was based in Beijing from 2008-2013, where he helped establish the Open Wisdom Lab at Tsinghua University, China’s MIT, to promote concepts of open and participatory science. He also helped establish Tsinghua’s Lifelong Learning Lab, which extends concepts of participatory science to children of all ages. He has also been a visiting Senior International Expert with the Chinese Academy of Sciences, where he initiated online citizen science in China through a project called CAS@home. Francois received a prestigious Fellowship from the South-Africa-based Shuttleworth Foundation in 2010-11, for his efforts to promote citizen science in the developing world.
