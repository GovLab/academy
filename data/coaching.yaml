    title: Passionate about Local Democracy?
    bullets:
      - Do you work in a local legislature or with local lawmakers?
      - Do you have a project designed to aid the lawmaking process – whether bills or rules - at the municipal level?
      - "Are you thinking about how to make law-making more transparent, participatory and accountable both online and off?"
  description_short: "Led by New York City Council member Ben Kallos, this program is designed for those working on civic-tech-enabled innovations in lawmaking and legislative processes at the local level."
  description_long: "This group is designed for those focusing on innovation in local lawmaking. Led by New York City Council Member Ben Kallos and supported by the GovLab Academy team, sign up if you want to collaborate to advance projects designed for use by legislators or in connection with legislatures at the local level. These might include projects for constituent engagement, crowdsourced lawmaking, enhanced drafting and archiving of local laws and rules, and other tech-enabled strategies for enhancing legitimacy and effectiveness in municipal legislatures and among local regulators. By bringing together those working on lawmaking at the local level we hope both to help each team advance its own project and, potentially, to discover opportunities for collaborating in the creation of turn-key solutions for the Legislature and legislators. Applicants need not work for government but should have a concrete project in mind, if not already underway."

    title: Passionate about Open Source? Are you…
    bullets:
      - "Someone seeking deployment of an IT system that performs a public function?"
      - "Is your project still in the design phase and needs help to develop it from idea to implementation?"
      - "Hoping to obtain substantial input from the public, up to/including co-creation?"

      - "Planning on scaling your project from the pilot phase with an iterative approach?"
  description_short: "This coaching program is designed to help projects that leverage open source technology to reshape how government procures, develops, and supports the application of civic technology to public problems. "
  description_long: >
    Open Source technology offers governments and institutions a chance to reshape how civic technology is procured, evolved, and supported. It allows cost sharing, vendor independence, co-innovation with constituents and other stakeholders, and greater trust and transparency in the operations of government. We'll work together to design your civic-tech project to make optimal use of this approach, from working with existing Open Source communities and organizations, to hosting "hackathons" and other creative ways of finding and engaging stakeholders, to, questions about software licensing and community stewardship.
  prerequisites:
    - At least one member of the team applying should have programming/IT background (a lot of this will be about how to work with the universe of other technical talent out there to accomplish the project!). But not all team members need to be technical nor is any prior knowledge of open source legal or technical approaches presumed.

  description_short: "Drawing on growing worldwide experience with technology-enabled innovation labs at different levels of government, this coaching program is designed to help those starting or running such labs learn from the experience of others"
  description_long: "Although there is no one shared definition of what constitutes a social or public lab, the “lab approach” might be expected to include experimentation in a safe space at one remove from everyday reality, with the goal of generating useful ideas that address social needs and demonstrating their effectiveness in practice There are several hundred ‘living labs’, mainly technology based, and enabling some user input to shaping technologies. More recently, labs of various kinds have spread into governments, some using design methods to better understand needs and opportunities, some focused on data, or using challenges to elicit ideas. Aimed at those teams and individuals who are actively starting or running social or public labs, this four week program combines online discussion and skill-building among diverse peers and with expert coaches. The program provides frequent and constructive feedback to help deepen and improve Lab practice."
  prerequisites:
    - "If you are still in the nascent stages of planning on creating a Lab, please have the support of at least one senior sponsor for the lab effort prior to signing up."

    title: Passionate about citizen science?
    bullets:
      - "Are you interested in tackling a scientific or environmental problem by engaging a wider public in tasks such as data gathering, measurement or other activities to aid in the execution of a science project?"
      - "Do you need to know how to target specific kinds of participants with the right know how?"
      - "Do you view citizens as scientists in their own right and want to support more people “doing science,” whether for educational or public policy purposes, in their own communities?"
      - "Is your citizen science project underway but needs to scale and attract more participants? Create more effective metrics?"
  description_short: "Time and again, citizen scientist -amateurs, enthusiasts, aficionados- have clearly shown they can make great contributions to public science projects. This coaching program is focused on the task of designing such projects in ways that best allow them to do so."
  description_long: "The notion that ordinary citizens with a strong interest in science – call them amateurs, enthusiasts, aficionados or even cheerleaders – can participate actively in cutting-edge science via the Web is no longer controversial. Galaxy Zoo (cataloguing galaxy images) and Foldit(folding proteins) are poster children for the citizen cyberscience movement. Perhaps even more intriguing are a number of smaller, less well-known projects like PrimeGrid (searching for new prime numbers) and Herbaria@home (digitizing archived historical plant clippings), where an amateur created a project, which is producing data professional scientists want to get their hands on. The right participant in this program knows civic problem they are trying to solve through the application of citizen science and has a citizen science project already in mind, if not already underway. Through peer to peer coaching and mentoring, the objective of this program is to help and encourage participants to develop more effective, scalable, and impactful citizen science projects. A particular preference for projects involving data collection and analysis, using the Web and mobile technologies."

    title: Passionate about fixing the public procurement process?
    bullets:
      - "Are you working to simplify the policy or regulations relating to procurement?"
      - "Do you have a project aimed at making procurement more transparent? Efficient? Accountable?"
      - "Are you eager to develop strategies for procuring more innovative and effective solutions from more diverse bidders?"
  description_short: "Most government procurement processes are, at best, burdensome and, more likely, broken. They are neither efficient nor inclusive, neither fully clean nor accountable. This coaching program is focused on supporting projects dedicated to changing that."
  description_long: "The way government purchases, especially information technology, is profoundly broken. Government should not be spending as much to make a website as it invests in scientific research to map the human brain. When the open government community talks about “Fixing Procurement” what we’re really talking about is making it so that the contracts don’t keep getting awarded to the same giant IT enterprise integrators over and over again. This group is designed for those focusing on all stages and types of contracting reform, bureaucracy and regulatory navigation at all levels of government, including projects to: simplify the RFP process; attract more minority and women-owned businesses; enable more open review and decision-making processes; encourage the procurement of innovative not only cheap solutions; decrease corruption and improve accountability, publish open contracting data or make sense of it. If you are engaged in an effort to bring greater sanity to the procurement process -- especially technology procurement -- come join us! The ideal candidate is someone who knows the problem they are trying to solve and who has a project in mind."
