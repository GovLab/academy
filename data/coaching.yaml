      - Do you work in a local legislature or with local lawmakers?
      - Do you have a project designed to aid the lawmaking process – whether bills or rules - at the municipal level?
      - "Are you thinking about how to make law-making more transparent, participatory and accountable both online and off?"
  description_short: "Led by New York City Council member Ben Kallos, this program is designed for those working on civic-tech-enabled innovations in lawmaking and legislative processes at the local level."
  description_long: "This group is designed for those focusing on innovation in local lawmaking. Led by New York City Council Member Ben Kallos and supported by the GovLab Academy team, sign up if you want to collaborate to advance projects designed for use by legislators or in connection with legislatures at the local level. These might include projects for constituent engagement, crowdsourced lawmaking, enhanced drafting and archiving of local laws and rules, and other tech-enabled strategies for enhancing legitimacy and effectiveness in municipal legislatures and among local regulators. By bringing together those working on lawmaking at the local level we hope both to help each team advance its own project and, potentially, to discover opportunities for collaborating in the creation of turn-key solutions for the Legislature and legislators. Applicants welcome from private, public and government sectors and should have a concrete project in mind, whether implementing or customizing an existing code base, or building something new, with goal of having a minimum viable product (MVP) ready to change the world."

  description_short: "This coaching program is designed to help projects that leverage open source technology to reshape how government procures, develops, and supports the application of civic technology to public problems. "
  description_long: >
    Open Source technology offers governments and institutions a chance to reshape how civic technology is procured, evolved, and supported. It allows cost sharing, vendor independence, co-innovation with constituents and other stakeholders, and greater trust and transparency in the operations of government. We'll work together to design your civic-tech project to make optimal use of this approach, from working with existing Open Source communities and organizations, to hosting "hackathons" and other creative ways of finding and engaging stakeholders, to, questions about software licensing and community stewardship.
  prerequisites:
    - At least one member of the team applying should have programming/IT background (a lot of this will be about how to work with the universe of other technical talent out there to accomplish the project!). But not all team members need to be technical nor is any prior knowledge of open source legal or technical approaches presumed.

  description_long: "Although there is no one shared definition of what constitutes a social or public lab, the “lab approach” might be expected to include experimentation in a safe space at one remove from everyday reality, with the goal of generating useful ideas that address social needs and demonstrating their effectiveness in practice There are several hundred ‘living labs’, mainly technology based, and enabling some user input to shaping technologies. More recently, labs of various kinds have spread into governments, some using design methods to better understand needs and opportunities, some focused on data, or using challenges to elicit ideas. Aimed at those teams and individuals who are actively starting or running social or public labs, this four week program combines online discussion and skill-building among diverse peers and with expert coaches. The program provides frequent and constructive feedback to help deepen and improve Lab practice."

  description_short: "Time and again, citizen scientist -amateurs, enthusiasts, aficionados- have clearly shown they can make great contributions to public science projects. This coaching program is focused on the task of designing such projects in ways that best allow them to do so."
  description_long: "The notion that ordinary citizens with a strong interest in science – call them amateurs, enthusiasts, aficionados or even cheerleaders – can participate actively in cutting-edge science via the Web is no longer controversial. Galaxy Zoo (cataloguing galaxy images) and Foldit (folding proteins) are poster children for the citizen cyberscience movement. Perhaps even more intriguing are a number of smaller, less well-known projects like PrimeGrid (searching for new prime numbers) and Herbaria@home (digitizing archived historical plant clippings), where an amateur created a project, which is producing data professional scientists want to get their hands on. The right participant in this program knows civic problem they are trying to solve through the application of citizen science and has a citizen science project already in mind, if not already underway. Through peer to peer coaching and mentoring, the objective of this program is to help and encourage participants to develop more effective, scalable, and impactful citizen science projects. A particular preference for projects involving data collection and analysis, using the Web and mobile technologies."

Government should not be spending as much to make a website as it invests in scientific research to map the human brain.

This group is designed for those focusing on all stages and types of contracting reform, bureaucracy and regulatory navigation at all levels of government, including projects to: simplify the RFP process; attract more minority and women-owned businesses; enable more open review and decision-making processes; encourage the procurement of innovative not only cheap solutions; decrease corruption and improve accountability, publish open contracting data or make sense of it. If you are engaged in an effort to bring greater sanity to the procurement process -- especially technology procurement -- come join us! The ideal candidate is someone who knows the problem they are trying to solve and who has a project in mind."

It seems risky and even unnatural to push problems out to vast groups of strangers distributed around the world, particularly for organizations and institutions built on a history of internal innovation. Understanding what kinds of problems a crowd really can handle better and how to manage the process requires careful design. However, after a decade of study, we have identified when crowds tend to outperform internal organizations (or not). This program is designed to help those wishing to integrate crowdsourcing into ongoing projects. Whether policymaking or service delivery in nature, we start from the assumption that, engaging citizens is generally both more effective and more legitimate as a way of working. Together we will explore how to better harness crowdsourcing and distributed innovation networks by offering guidance on choosing the best form of crowdsourcing for a given situation. Applicants should have a clear view of the problem they are trying to solve and either an ongoing or an about-to-start crowdsourcing project. Although everyone is invited to apply, there will be an admissions preference for those working at the city-level."

  description_long: "Contracts are fundamental to how governments generate and spend. Contracts are at the nexus of revenue generation, budget planning, resource management and delivery of public goods. Contracts are at the core of how countries operate. Governments around the world spend an estimated US $9.5 trillion every single year through contracts. Yet, contracting information is often unavailable for public scrutiny. Adding to the problems stemming from lack of transparency, the resources spent through these contracts are often poorly managed or misappropriated. When companies, governments and citizens continue to get hit by ineffective and unfair contracting practices, theft and waste, everyone is paying the price. Ultimately, contracting that is not open undermines development for all. Open contracting refers to norms and practices for increased disclosure and participation in public contracting including tendering, performance and completion and it encompasses all public contracting, including contracts funded by combinations of public, private and donor sources. This group is designed for those with projects focusing on fully realize the promise of open contracting on all stages and contract types, from more basic contracts for the procurement of goods, to complex contracts, joint venture agreements, licenses and production sharing agreements."
